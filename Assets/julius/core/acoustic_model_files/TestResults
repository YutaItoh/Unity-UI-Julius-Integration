DISCLAIMER: this is a *sanity test* only, and is *not* to be regarded as a valid test of the VoxForge Acoustic Models!
 * the speech files used for testing use a single person's voice;
 * the same person also contributed speech for the creation of the VoxForge the Acoustic Models;
 * there are only 50 audio samples in the test database - not enough for a good test;
 * the VoxForge Acoustic Models are still an alpha release with respect to Speaker Independent Speech Recognition, so please donate some speech to VoxForge,

 thanks,

 VoxForge team

Notes:

    * the line starting with SENT gives the percentage of sentences that were recognized correctly, out of N sentences in total.
    * the line starting with WORD gives the percentage of words that were recognized correctly, out of N words in total
      However, since HTK or Julius erroneously 'added' words that are not in the audio file (i.e. insertion errors) they usually get a lower percentage accuracy rating.
    * Count definitions:
          o D - Deletion Error
          o S - Substitution Error
          o I - Insertion Error
